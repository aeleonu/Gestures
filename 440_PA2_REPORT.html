<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
The motivation behind our project is to distinguish simple hand gestures by implementing our algorithm using the techniques such as convex hull and convexity defects. I had to use some of the techniques we discussed in class and then do research on how to do it in Python.

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<li><p> background differencing: used BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 to subtract background.
<p>	bgModel = cv2.BackgroundSubtractorMOG2(0, bgSubThreshold)
<p>	fgmask = bgModel.apply(frame)
<li><p> frame-to-frame differencing: we apply the model to a frame. 
<p>	res = cv2.bitwise_and(frame, frame, mask=fgmask)
<li><p> skin-color detection (e.g., thresholding red and green pixel values)
<p> cv2.threshold(blurred, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV+cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
<li><p> Convex Hull
<p> cv2.convexHull(cnt)

<h2> Requirements </h2>  
<p>The user should be sitting in front of the still camera with their torso in the view of
                    the camera and try to avoid any excessive movement with their body.
<p>The user should try to be in a well lit area with a background that does not have
                    many moving background objects and should have a background that doesn't blend with the user's skin color.</li>
<p>The user should not move their hand excessively while the program is computing the hand gestures.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
<p>This was a very long project. It took longer than usual because of Easter, as well as the fact that I kept getting errors trying to do it in C++ with the use of the debugger in the FindContours function. I eventually decided to do the project in Python 2.7 and I was able to get the threshold and contours functions running, the only problem was that the blobs would appear and dissapear so I avoided them altogether. 

In the Confusion Matrix, I tested each gesture 10 times. Although the contour window was small, the model for gestures seemed to work pretty well. I think that there are many ways to improve and expand on the gesture recognition in this project, because while this is based entirely on movement, a more full-featured gesture recognition program could incorporate techniques for analyzing still images like an axial-projection histogram for skin tone detection.
